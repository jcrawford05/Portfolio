# James Crawford - Data & Analytics Portfolio

This portfolio brings together a set of projects built around working carefully with data. The work moves from raw inputs through cleaning, organization, and analysis, with an emphasis on producing results that are clear, well-structured, and genuinely useful.

The goal across these projects is consistency and clarity. Data is cleaned carefully, assumptions are made explicit, and results are presented in a way that supports exploration rather than overselling conclusions.

## Global Temperature Change Explorer

**End-to-end data visualization and analytics project**  
Static web deployment with engineered datasets

This project is a web-based application for exploring long-term temperature trends across the United States. It takes large climate datasets and reshapes them into formats that support meaningful comparisons over time and across regions.

Unlike the other demos in this portfolio, this project is a native web application built specifically for interactive exploration.

**What This Project Shows**

- Cleaning and aggregating climate data across time and geographic levels  
- Structuring datasets to support interactive analysis in the browser  
- Translating analytical questions into visual, user-driven exploration  
- Communicating long-term trends without relying on technical background  

**Analytical Capabilities**

- Compare temperature trends across states over multiple decades  
- Examine regional similarities and differences  
- Switch between absolute values and relative change (delta)  
- View data at monthly or yearly resolution  

**Technology Stack**

- JavaScript (ES6), D3.js  
- TopoJSON / GeoJSON  
- HTML, CSS  
- CSV-based analytical datasets

## Socioeconomic Factors in Automotive Accident Fatalities

**Exploratory data analysis project**

This project examines how income, education, employment, and insurance coverage relate to fatal motor vehicle accident rates across U.S. states. The emphasis is on understanding patterns in the data rather than building predictive models.

Care is taken to separate correlation from causation and to present results in a way that is readable for non-technical audiences.

**What This Project Shows**

- Cleaning and merging data from multiple public sources  
- Using visualizations to explore relationships between variables  
- Interpreting observational data with appropriate caution  
- Maintaining a reproducible and well-documented workflow  

**Key Observations**

- Socioeconomic conditions differ substantially by state  
- Several indicators show consistent correlation with fatality rates  
- Results describe relationships, not causal mechanisms  

**Technology Stack**

- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn

## Dictionary Application (Java)

**Data structures and performance analysis project**

This project is a Java-based dictionary application designed to support fast word lookup, range queries, definition management, and metadata reporting. As the dataset grows, predictable runtime behavior becomes the main design concern.

A browser-based demo reproduces the behavior of the original Java console program so the system can be explored without compiling or running Java code. The demo is intended to match program logic closely, not to serve as a simplified mock.

**What This Project Shows**

- Custom data structure and API design  
- Reasoning about runtime complexity and performance tradeoffs  
- Measuring performance through controlled timing experiments  
- Separating core logic, experimentation, and presentation  

**Included Components**

- Core dictionary implementation and supporting classes  
- Dedicated timing drivers for major operations  
- Benchmark datasets used for testing  
- Written analysis comparing measured performance to expectations  

**Technology Stack**

- Java  
- Data Structures  
- Time/Space Complexity Analysis  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (demo)  

**Links**

- Repository: https://github.com/jcrawford05/Dictionary  
- Live Demo: https://jcrawford05.github.io/Dictionary/

*Note on demos:* With the exception of the Global Temperature Change Explorer, demo pages in this portfolio are built to replicate the behavior of their original programs as closely as possible, but some limitations exist. For a full compilation of the code, please execute the files, or reach out for a recorded demo of the program!

## Professional Emphasis

Across these projects, several key skills are consistent:

- Taking raw data and transforming that data into practical, user-centered metrics
- Designing systems that scale, considering space, and time efficiency   
- Prioritizing user-first clarity in both analysis and presentation   

This portfolio will continue to evolve as new work is added and existing projects are refined.
